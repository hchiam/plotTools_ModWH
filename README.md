# plotTools_ModWH
A mod of plotTools.xml to account for variable plot Width and Height.

## Features:

1) Ability to enter a string of digits (and percent symbol) and have them printed on a plot.
2) Ability to resize/stretch digits based on a factor, such as for variable-width plots.
3) Ability to resize an arrow to be drawn on a plot. (This feature is still under construction.)

## Future fix:

Need to improve scaling of arrow.
